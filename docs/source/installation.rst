Installation
============

Typically you need:

.. code:: bash

    pip install kickoff


If you would like to use GUI, please also install *quick* package:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/szsdk/quick


Note that GUI also requires Qt5 toolkit as well as Python bindings to be installed. System-specific package manager should be used here.
